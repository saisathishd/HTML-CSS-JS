<!-- IIF
An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function) is a function that runs the moment it is invoked or called in the JavaScript event loop. Having a function that behaves that way can be useful in certain situations. 
Adv:
1. IIFE does not create unnecessary global variables and functions.
2. Functions and variables created in IIFE do not conflict with other functions & variables even if they have the same name.
3. Organize JavaScript code.
